            <p>Hello, I'm Gabe Mukobi! I am a digital creator who is passionate about virtual reality, games, AI, film,
              music, 3D art, and photography. At Stanford University, I'm studying computer science with a focus on
              AI and graphics, and I'm involved in several VR and music clubs. I aspire to create tools, media, and
              experiences that combine creativity with technology to uplift others and make the world a better place.

            <p>Rogue Starfighter VR (RSVR) is an immersive virtual reality Star Wars X-wing flight simulator fan-game.
              In it, the
              player experiences the full scale and power of the space combat from a galaxy far, far, away behind the
              controls of an
              immersive and fully-interactive T-65B X-wing starfighter.
            </p>
            <p>My main goals in RSVR’s development were to create compelling cockpit control interactions driven by the
              player’s VR
              hands; to create a beautifully fun experience through highly detailed and customized models, VFX, shaders,
              and sound
              design; and to learn a lot about game development by building a full vertical slice of a large project.

            <p>PieWallet is a hybrid cryptocurrency wallet and social media web app built in PHP and JavaScript as a
              freelance project:
              If you crossed your favourite cryptocurrency with Venmo, you might get something like PieWallet. For
              security, users
              must record their private keys offline until ready for exchange with a linked partner, but public keys
              are paired with
              profiles and stored in PieWallet’s database allowing for social interactions like user search,
              following/followers, and
              crypto requests.</p>
            <p>Building PieWallet necessitated learning technical knowledge of <a
                href="https://github.com/mukobi/PieWallet/tree/master/server">social networks</a> for functionality
              like
              user profile
              creation/login/editing and many-to-many nonreciprocal follow relationships; of <a

                calls</a> for
              updating balance and history information and propagating user actions through the network; and of

                cryptocurrency</a> to securely generate new private keys from a numeric or word-phrase seed on the
