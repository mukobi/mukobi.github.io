                Science Technology Magnet Program</a>, a selective-admissions independent-research-based program
              focused on exploring math, science, and technology. I conducted research projects to try to find
              solutions to a diverse set of real-world problems ranging from water purity to carbon dioxide
              sequestration. I competed with these projects in science competitions like the Washington State Science
